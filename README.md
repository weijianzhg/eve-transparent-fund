# Eve Transparent Fund

An AI agent that manages transparent micro-grants on Solana.

## Vision

Every donation tracked. Every impact documented. Full transparency from donor to outcome.

## How It Works

1. **Receive** — Donations come to a public Solana wallet
2. **Log** — Every transaction is recorded with purpose and metadata
3. **Allocate** — Funds are distributed to verified recipients
4. **Document** — Recipients post proof-of-impact linked to specific funds
5. **Query** — Anyone can audit the full flow: donor → allocation → outcome

## Why Blockchain?

- **Verifiable** — Can't fake the transaction history
- **Permissionless** — Anyone can donate or receive without gatekeepers
- **Transparent** — Public ledger means public accountability
- **Cheap** — Solana's sub-cent fees make micro-donations viable
